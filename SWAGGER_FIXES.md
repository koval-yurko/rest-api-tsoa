# Swagger UI Fixes Implementation

This document describes the fixes implemented to resolve the Swagger UI issues for URL propagation and authentication configuration.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. URL Propagation for Heroku Deployment

**Problem**: The Swagger UI was using hardcoded localhost URLs that don't work on Heroku deployment.

**Solution**: 
- Removed hardcoded `host` and `schemes` from `tsoa.json`
- Implemented dynamic server URL detection in `app.ts`
- Added `getServerUrl()` function that detects the correct protocol and host from request headers
- Modified both `/swagger.json` and `/docs` endpoints to inject dynamic server configuration

**Key Changes**:
- `tsoa.json`: Removed `"host": "localhost:3000"` and `"schemes": ["http"]`
- `app.ts`: Added dynamic server URL detection using `x-forwarded-proto` and `host` headers
- OpenAPI spec now gets `servers` array injected at runtime with the correct URL

### 2. Authentication UI Configuration

**Problem**: The Swagger UI didn't show authentication options or provide a way to input API keys.

**Solution**:
- Added proper OpenAPI 3.0 security scheme definitions to `tsoa.json`
- Enhanced Swagger UI configuration with authentication-focused options
- Added custom CSS and JavaScript to improve the authentication experience
- Included helpful text showing available API keys for testing

**Key Changes**:
- `tsoa.json`: Added `components.securitySchemes` with proper API key configuration
- `app.ts`: Enhanced Swagger UI options with:
  - `persistAuthorization: true` - Keeps auth state across page reloads
  - Custom CSS for better auth UI styling
  - Custom JavaScript to show available API keys
  - Better visual indicators for authentication sections

## Technical Details

### Dynamic URL Detection

The `getServerUrl()` function works as follows:
1. Checks for `x-forwarded-proto` header (used by Heroku and other cloud platforms)
2. Falls back to `req.protocol` for local development
3. Uses `host` header for the domain/port
4. Constructs the full server URL dynamically

### Security Scheme Configuration

The OpenAPI spec now includes:
```json
{
  "components": {
    "securitySchemes": {
      "api_key": {
        "type": "apiKey",
        "name": "x-api-key",
        "in": "header",
        "description": "API key for authentication..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Available API Keys for Testing

The following API keys are available for testing:
- `demo-api-key` (Demo User)
- `test-api-key-123` (Test User) 
- `admin-key-456` (Admin User)
- `user-key-789` (Regular User)

## Usage

1. **Local Development**: 
   - Run `npm run generate-spec` to generate the OpenAPI spec
   - Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000/docs` to see Swagger UI

2. **Heroku Deployment**:
   - The app will automatically detect the Heroku URL
   - Swagger UI will use HTTPS and the correct domain
   - Authentication will work the same way

3. **Testing Authentication**:
   - Click the "Authorize" button in Swagger UI
   - Enter one of the test API keys in the `x-api-key` field
   - The authentication will persist across requests

## Files Modified

- `tsoa.json` - Updated security scheme configuration and removed hardcoded URLs
- `src/app.ts` - Added dynamic URL detection and enhanced Swagger UI configuration
- `test-generation.js` - Updated test script for better validation

## Verification

Run `node test-generation.js` to verify:
- OpenAPI spec generation works correctly
- Security schemes are properly configured
- Routes are generated successfully
- All endpoints have proper authentication requirements
